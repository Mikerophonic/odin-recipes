    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The noodles and chard are silky, which begs for the salty crunch of the breadcrumbs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup panko</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>12 ounces bucatini</li>
        <li>5 oil-packed anchovy filets, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 serrano chile, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 bunch small Swiss chard, ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely torn (about 5 cups)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup coarsley chopped mint</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>Finely grated Pecorino (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a small skillet over medium. Cook garlic, swirling in pan often, until golden and crisp,
            about 2 minutes. Transfer garlic to a small bowl with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Add panko to same skillet and cook, stirring often, until golden, about 5 minutes; season with salt and
            pepper. Transfer to bowl with garlic.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente. Drain,
            reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 3 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook anchovies, mashing with a wooden spoon,
            until only a few flecks remain, about 4 minutes. Add chile and Swiss chard and cook until Swiss chard is
            slightly wilted, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add butter, pasta, and Â½ cup pasta cooking liquid to Swiss chard mixture and cook, tossing often with tongs
            and adding more pasta cooking liquid if sauce looks dry, until sauce is emulsified and coats pasta. Remove
            from heat and stir in mint, lemon zest, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Divide pasta among bowls. Drizzle with oil; top with garlicky breadcrumbs and Pecorino.</li>
    </ol>
